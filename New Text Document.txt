Every year since 1989 Autocar has collected together the finest new cars from the previous 12 months and subjected them to a rigorous test on both road and track.
Using our team of highly experienced road testers, we set out to find the best driver’s car of the year. 2018’s contest was as competitive as ever – but there was only one winner.
